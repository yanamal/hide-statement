<p>This is a landing page for the hide-statement chrome extension.</p>

<p>It's a tiny chrome extension which hides the problem statement in a Codility challenge (thus making it even more challenging).
Its functionality be toggled on/off by clicking on its icon (the blue or gray H) in the icon bar.</p>

<p>If you have chrome, you should install this extension.</p>

<p>An alternative to the chrome extension is to use a bookmarklet:
<br/>
<a class="bookmarklet" href="javascript:(function()%7Bdocument.getElementById('brinza-task-description').style.backgroundColor%20%3D%20%22black%22%7D)()">Hide Problem</a>
</p>
