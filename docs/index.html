This is a landing page for the hide-statement chrome extension.

It's a tiny chrome extension which hides the problem statement in a Codility challenge (thus making it even more challenging).
Its functionality be toggled on/off by clicking on its icon (the blue or gray H) in the icon bar.

If you have chrome, you should install this extension.

An alternative to the chrome extension is to use a bookmarklet:

<a class="bookmarklet" href="javascript:(function()%7Bdocument.getElementById('brinza-task-description').style.backgroundColor%20%3D%20%22black%22%7D)()">Hide Problem</a>
